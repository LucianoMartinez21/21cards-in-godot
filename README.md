# 21 Cards Game in Godot.
Small game that implements the game of 21 cards.

Things to fix are:
- Fast NPC playturn.
- Fast Dealer playturn.
- Player not register the first card they receive.
- change the minimum floor score from 18 to 17 points.
- check if the closest to 21 algorithm checks if the closest score is lower or equal to 21 than higher or equal to 21.
